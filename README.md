# Floward Take Home Assessment

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the submissions for the following tasks as part of the ongoing project analysis:

1. **Case Study 1 (Task ii) - Clustering**: 
   - Filename: [`task-2-case-study-1-clustering.ipynb`](https://github.com/ssulaihasubi/floward-take-home-assessment/blob/main/task-2-case-study-1-clustering.ipynb)
   - Description: This notebook implements clustering algorithms to segment the customer data. The objective was to identify distinct customer segments that could be targeted with personalized marketing strategies.

2. **Case Study 1 (Task iii) - A/B Testing**: 
   - Filename: [`task-3-case-study-1-ab-testing.ipynb`](https://github.com/ssulaihasubi/floward-take-home-assessment/blob/main/task-3-case-study-1-ab-testing.ipynb)
   - Description: This notebook involves the design and analysis of A/B tests aimed at evaluating the impact of promotional offers and free shipping on conversion rates. The analysis includes statistical tests to determine the effectiveness of the tested strategies.

3. **Case Study 1 (Task iv) - Business Dashboard Development (Work in Progress)**:
   - **KPI Definition**:
     - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) based on the insights from the EDA and cluster analysis.
     - Ensure that the KPIs are relevant, measurable, and aligned with business objectives.
   - **Dashboard Development**:
     - Create a Tableau dashboard that visualizes the KPIs clearly and concisely.
     - Include interactive features (e.g., filters, drill-downs) for users to explore the data further.
     - Ensure that the dashboard is user-friendly and can be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
       
4. **Case Study 2 - Anomaly Detection**: 
   - Filename: [`case-study-2-anomaly-detection.ipynb`](https://github.com/ssulaihasubi/floward-take-home-assessment/blob/main/case-study-2-anomaly-detection.ipynb)
   - Description: This notebook addresses the anomaly detection task for the main metrics of Floward. It leverages machine learning techniques to identify outliers and abnormal patterns in the data, which could indicate underlying issues in the business operations.
