    "#### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "This document outlines the A/B testing strategy for implementing an upselling and cross-selling feature on the checkout page at Floward. The goal of this test is to determine whether presenting relevant upsell and cross-sell suggestions during the checkout process can increase the average order value (AOV) and overall revenue without negatively impacting the conversion rate.\n"

    "\n",
    "**2.1. Upselling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**  \n",
    "  Upselling is a sales technique where a seller encourages the customer to purchase a more expensive, upgraded, or premium version of the item being considered. The objective is to increase the overall transaction value by offering a product with enhanced features or benefits that provide more value to the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example - Apple:**  \n",
    "  Apple is a master of upselling. When a customer is considering buying an iPhone, Apple might suggest a higher-end model with more storage capacity or additional features like a better camera. For instance, if a customer is looking at the iPhone 15, Apple might upsell them to the iPhone 15 Pro Max by highlighting the superior camera system and longer battery life.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2. Cross-Selling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**  \n",
    "  Cross-selling involves suggesting complementary products or services to the customer that enhance or are related to the item they are purchasing. The goal is to increase the overall basket size by encouraging customers to add additional items to their purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example - Amazon:**  \n",
    "  Amazon excels in cross-selling by showing customers related products on the product page, during checkout, or in the \"Frequently Bought Together\" section. For example, if a customer is purchasing a Kindle, Amazon might cross-sell a protective case, a screen protector, or a Kindle Unlimited subscription, all of which are complementary to the main product.\n"

The target is to achieve statistical significance with a 95% confidence level and 80% power. Assuming a current AOV of $50, and expecting a 10% increase, we might need approximately 5,000 users per group (control and treatment).\n",
